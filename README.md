# Synthetic Medical Claims Data

This project generates and processes synthetic medical claims data using [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients.

## Overview

The repository contains:
- Synthetic healthcare data for 112 patients generated by Synthea
- Python scripts to join the separate data files into a unified claims dataset
- Source CSV files covering patients, encounters, claims, procedures, medications, and more

## Data Structure

The `synthea_output/csv/` folder contains 18 interconnected CSV files:

| File | Description | Records |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `patients.csv` | Patient demographics | 112 |
| `encounters.csv` | Healthcare visits/encounters | 8,211 |
| `claims.csv` | Insurance claims | 15,181 |
| `claims_transactions.csv` | Claim line items/transactions | 107,309 |
| `procedures.csv` | Medical procedures performed | 15,228 |
| `conditions.csv` | Diagnoses/conditions | 4,131 |
| `medications.csv` | Prescribed medications | 6,970 |
| `observations.csv` | Clinical observations (vitals, labs) | - |
| `providers.csv` | Healthcare providers | 285 |
| `organizations.csv` | Healthcare facilities | 285 |
| `payers.csv` | Insurance payers | 10 |
| `allergies.csv` | Patient allergies | - |
| `immunizations.csv` | Immunization records | - |
| `careplans.csv` | Care plan information | - |
| `devices.csv` | Medical devices | - |
| `imaging_studies.csv` | Imaging/radiology studies | - |
| `supplies.csv` | Medical supplies used | - |
| `payer_transitions.csv` | Insurance coverage history | - |

### Data Relationships

```

  └── encounters
        ├── claims → claims_transactions
        ├── procedures
        ├── conditions
        ├── medications
        └── observations
```

## Usage

### Join All Data into One File

Run the join script to create a unified dataset:

```bash
python join_claims_data.py
```

This produces `joined_claims_data.csv` with:
- **107,309 rows** (one per claim transaction)
- **155 columns** (combining all related tables)
- Patient demographics, encounter details, claim information, provider data, and clinical data

### Output Columns Include

- **Transaction**: ID, type, amount, payments, procedure codes
- **Claim**: claim ID, diagnoses (1-8), status, service dates
- **Encounter**: start/stop times, class, description, costs
- **Patient**: name, DOB, address, gender, income
- **Provider**: name, specialty, organization
- **Payer**: insurance name, coverage amounts
- **Clinical**: aggregated procedures, conditions, medications per encounter

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Generating New Synthetic Data

To generate fresh synthetic data, download Synthea and run:

```bash
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -p 100 Massachusetts
```

Note: The `synthea-with-dependencies.jar` file is not included in this repository due to size constraints. Download it from the [Synthea releases page](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/releases).

## File Size Notes

The following files are excluded from the repository (via `.gitignore`) due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit:
- `joined_claims_data.csv` (~230MB) - regenerate with `python join_claims_data.py`
- `synthea-with-dependencies.jar` (~174MB) - download from Synthea releases
